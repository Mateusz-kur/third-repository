       <h3>by SABATON</h3>
       <p>Baptised in fire. Forty to one</p>
       <p>So silent before the storm Awaiting command A few has been chosen to stand As one outnumbered by far The orders from high command Fight back, hold your ground! In early September it came A war unknown to the world</p>
       <p>No army may entered that land That is protected by Polish hand Unless you are forty to one Your force will soon be undone undone</p>
       <p>Baptised in fire Forty to one Spirit of Spartans Death and glory Soldiers of Poland Second to none Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt</p>
       <p>The 8th of September it starts The rage of the Reich A barrage of mortars and guns Stand past, the bunkers will hold The captain has pledged his life I'll face my fate here! The sound of artillery strike So fierce the thunder of guns</p>
       <p>So come, bring on all that you've got Come hell, come high water, never stop Unless you are forty to one Your lives will soon be undone undone</p>
       <p>Baptised in fire Forty to one Spirit of Spartans Death and glory Soldiers of Poland Second to none Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt</p>
       <p>Always remember, a fallen soldier Always remember, fathers and sons at war Always remember, a fallen soldier Always remember, fathers and sons at war Always remember, a fallen soldier Always remember, buried in history</p>
       <p>No army may enter that land That is protected by Polish hand Unless you are forty to one Your force will soon be undone</p>
       <p>Baptised in fire Forty to one Spirit of Spartans Death and glory Soldiers of Poland Second to none Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt</p>
